### Introduction
Our study employs sophisticated methodologies to explore age-related nuances in load management strategies. For WNBA athletes, we analyze age-conditioned average treatment effects (ACTE) curves, unraveling the interplay between age and the impact of load management on player performance. In addition, we also add a bootstrapping for estimation of errors in our ACTE curves of both NBA and WNBA athletes. Our investigations not only contribute to sports science discourse but also offer actionable insights for coaches and practitioners, aiming to refine age-specific load-management strategies in professional basketball.
